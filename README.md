## Rules

### General rules of debate
- Listen respectfully, without interrupting.
- Listen actively and with an ear to understanding others’ views. (Don’t just think about what you are going to say while someone else is talking.)
- Criticize ideas, not individuals. We all can learn something from each other, even if your views don’t necessarily align.
- Avoid blame, speculation, and inflammatory language.
- Allow everyone the chance to speak.
- Avoid assumptions about any member of the class or generalizations about social groups. Do not ask individuals to speak for their (perceived) social group.
- We are accountable for our words and their impact.
- Personal information that comes up in the conversation should be kept confidential.
